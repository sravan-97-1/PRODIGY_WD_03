tic-tac-toe game with the single player and multi player option with interactive design
This project is a fully functional and visually engaging Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play in two distinct modes: either with a friend in Two Player Mode, or solo against a basic System AI opponent in Single Player Mode. The design is clean, modern, and responsive, offering a smooth and interactive user experience across all devices.
The goal of this project is not only to implement classic Tic-Tac-Toe game logic but also to enhance the interface using modern web design trends and user-friendly animations.

üß© Key Features
Dual Game Modes:
Users can switch between Two Player and System Mode using toggle buttons. In Two Player Mode, two users take turns playing locally. In System Mode, the player competes against a simple AI that chooses empty spots randomly.
Modern User Interface:
The game is styled with a gradient background and a glassmorphism card layout that gives it a fresh and elegant appearance. The UI is responsive, adapting seamlessly to both desktop and mobile screens.
Enhanced User Interaction:
Cells respond to hover and click actions with subtle animations. When a player wins, the winning cells are highlighted with a glowing animation, providing clear and engaging feedback.
Game Status Updates:
Real-time updates inform players whose turn it is, when someone wins, or if the match ends in a draw. A reset button allows the game to be replayed instantly without reloading the page.
Responsive Design:
The layout is optimized to look great on all screen sizes, from smartphones to large monitors.

üìÅ File Structure
The project is organized into three separate files to maintain clean code separation:
index.html ‚Äî Contains the structure and layout of the game board, controls, and status message.
style.css ‚Äî Manages all visual elements, including layout, colors, fonts, shadows, and animations.
script.js ‚Äî Handles the core game logic such as tracking player turns, detecting win conditions, toggling between game modes, and controlling the AI behavior.
